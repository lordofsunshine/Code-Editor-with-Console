# 🌹 **What's New: 0.1.5** 
- [x] The editor’s design has been slightly reworked. Some animations were fixed, unnecessary blocks were removed, and it’s now more pleasant to use our editor.
- [x] If you click the "code-editor" label, a panel with essential information and useful links will open.
- [x] For some reason, the code-editor.world domain no longer works. Please note that the code-editor.pro domain will stop working in October 2025. Use the code-editor.run domain.

*P.S. I would have liked to completely rewrite the code editor, but every time I started, development kept stalling. Perhaps someday I’ll manage to rewrite the editor and show it to you. Thank you.*
