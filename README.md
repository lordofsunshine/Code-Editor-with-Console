# Code Editor with Console (v.0.0.4)
This web code editor is an interactive environment that allows users to write and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. It features an output window to display results and a console for logging messages and errors. The editor supports a run() function that executes the code entered into the respective fields and displays the results in the output window. The console logs both standard messages and errors, providing timestamps for convenient debugging.

The web code editor is a convenient tool for developers that allows writing and testing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in the browser. The main features of the editor include:
- **Live Preview:** Changes in the code are instantly reflected in the preview window, allowing for quick testing and debugging.
- **Integrated JavaScript Testing:** The ability to run and test JavaScript code immediately after writing it.
- **Multilingual Support:** The editor supports code editing in multiple programming languages.
- **Ease of Use:** An intuitive interface makes working with code easier for developers of all levels.
