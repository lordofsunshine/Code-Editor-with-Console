# üéâ **What's New: 0.1.2** üéâ

### üöÄ Performance Boost & Eye Candy
- [x] We've given our preloader a makeover and added some meta-tags (because who doesn't love a good meta-tag, right?). 
- [x] The code editor now moves smoother than a buttered-up penguin on ice. 
- [x] Buttons now have a subtle texture on hover, thanks to some box-shadow magic.

### üí° Tooltip
- [x] Hover over buttons for tooltips that pop up faster than your cat when you open a can of tuna.
- [ ] Sorry, mobile users, no hover for you. Your fingers aren't psychic... yet.

### üßπ Winter Cleaning for Our Code
- [x] We've Marie Kondo'd our JavaScript and CSS. If it didn't spark joy, it's gone!
- [x] CSS is now neatly organized with comments. It's so tidy, it would make your mom proud.

### ‚è∞ Time-Stamped Console Logs
- [x] Console logs now come with timestamps. Because even logs need to know what time it is!

### üîó URL Magic
- [x] Switching files now updates the URL.

### üç™ Farewell to Cookies
- [x] We've said goodbye to cookies. It's a sad day for our sweet tooth, but a good day for your privacy.

### üêõ Bug Squashing
- [x] Remember that pesky JavaScript code showing up in the Preview window? We've sent it packing to its own corner. Your code is now free from uninvited guests!

So there you have it, folks! Our little code editor is growing up so fast. *wipes tear* They grow up so quickly, don't they?
