# üéÑ **What's New: v.0.1.3 (refactoring)** üéÑ

- [x] ***02.01.25:*** Massive code refactoring.

- [x] Now, if you've written something in the code editor and try to close the tab, you'll be prompted to save the project (of course, you can decline if you wish).
- [x] The "Open in New tab" function has been improved. Now you can view the site with a real URL instead of about:blank, and you can even reload the page.
- [x] We've fixed the syntax highlighting for JavaScript code. It now works correctly.
- [x] We've updated the console: the console is now highlighted! Each log will be labeled as SUCCESS, INFO, ERROR, or WARN and will be marked with the corresponding color. The console now also has **COMMANDS**: enter the command `editor help` in the code editor's terminal and see for yourself!
- [x] Numerous bugs have been fixed, including issues related to object positioning and other aspects. The editor's code is now split into two files: App.vue and all its JavaScript code.

**Happy upcoming New Year 2025!** And I'd like to boast a bit: the project already weighs 30MB and contains over a thousand lines of code. üëÄ
